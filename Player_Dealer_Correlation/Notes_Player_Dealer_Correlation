From what I've seen, Mylie Schmidt has been playing a lot during the times the losses occurred, and Billy Jones was the roulette dealer at the times of the loss.
Therefore, I believe Mylie Schmidt and Billy Jones are colluding to scam Lucky Duck.
There were many players that played at the times of the losses, but Mylie Schmidt has shown up to all the times the losses occurred.
Every other player has only shown up once.
Billy Jones was also at the table at every loss hour.
