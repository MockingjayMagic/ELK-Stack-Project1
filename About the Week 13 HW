#Week 13 HW

This part of the Cybersecurity Bootcamp Course hosted by the University of Toronto School of Continuing Studies explores the content from Week 12 and 13 of the course, in which we used our own Microsoft Azure accounts to create a network of virtual machines, virtual network groups, and various other resources to ensure that the groups are run as intended. This respository also includes the playbook (.yml) files and the Linux script (.sh) files created throughout the course of the course.
